# Introduction

I've been working in [Antelope](https://antelope.io/) (former EOSIO) blockchain space since the EOS mainnet launch. During this time, I met a great number of wonderful people, and we have run some interesting projects together. As as a software engineer and an open source enthusiast, I've always tried to share as much knowledge as possible, and this has led to a number of publications in [my blog](https://cc32d9.medium.com/) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/cc32d9).

In this book I will try to address most common questions asked in the [Antelope Developers](https://t.me/antelopedevs) chat, and give my recommendations on designing the smart contracts and blockchain applications.&#x20;

While talking to many software developers, I found out that the most missing thing in Antelope/EOSIO is the understanding of the big picture. Basically, how stuff works. I will try to cover that as much as possible, as this topic is of interest on all levels of blockchain businesses: business owners, software architects, developers, and server administrators.

THIS WRITING IS STILL IN PROGRESS. Some chapters are not finished yet, and some examples are missing. Also proofreading hasn't started.
